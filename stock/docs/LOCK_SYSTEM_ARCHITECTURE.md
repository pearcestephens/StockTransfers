# Simple Lock System - SSE + BroadcastChannel Architecture

## Overview
Real-time, multi-tab lock coordination system with instant detection and hardened server performance.

---

## Architecture

### Three-Layer Communication

```
Layer 1: BroadcastChannel (0ms)
  ↓ Same browser tabs communicate instantly
  
Layer 2: Server-Sent Events (50-500ms)
  ↓ Cross-browser/device real-time push
  
Layer 3: Visibility/Focus Checks (on-demand)
  ↓ Verification when tab becomes active
```

## Server Hardening (lock_events.php)

### Performance Protections

1. **Connection Limits**
   - Max duration: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
   - Max iterations: 300 (1 check per second)
   - Auto-closes and forces client reconnect

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Prepared statement created once
   - `closeCursor()` after each fetch (frees memory)
   - Query timeout: 3 seconds
   - `LIMIT 1` on all queries

3. **State Tracking Efficiency**
   - Only broadcasts on **state changes** (not every iteration)
   - Lightweight state signature: `owner:tab:token` (not full JSON)
   - No unnecessary data sent

4. **Connection Monitoring**
   - `connection_aborted()` checked every iteration
   - Zombie connections terminated immediately
   - Error logging for debugging

5. **Heartbeat Optimization**
   - Sent every 30 seconds (not every iteration)
   - Prevents client timeout without spamming

6. **Input Validation**
   - Parameter length limits enforced
   - Prevents injection/abuse

7. **Resource Cleanup**
   - Explicit PDO cleanup on exit
   - Proper error handling with early returns

### Event Types Sent

| Event | When | Payload |
|-------|------|---------|
| `connected` | Initial connection | resource, tab_id, max_duration |
| `lock_stolen` | Lock taken by another tab/user | by_owner, by_tab, same_owner, expires_in |
| `lock_released` | Lock released | resource |
| `heartbeat` | Every 30s | iteration, max |
| `timeout` | 5min limit reached | message |
| `error` | Server error | message |
| `closed` | Normal exit | reason, iterations |

## Client Hardening (simple-lock.js)

### Connection Management

1. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Only one SSE connection per lock instance
   - `startSSE()` guards against multiple calls

2. **Reconnect Logic**
   - Max 5 reconnect attempts
   - Exponential backoff: 2 seconds
   - Only reconnects if connection dies **before** 5min timeout
   - Stops reconnecting after 5 failed attempts

3. **Lock State Validation**
   - SSE only starts when lock is **actively held**
   - SSE stops immediately when lock is lost
   - No orphan connections

4. **Timeout Handling**
   - Listens for server `timeout` event
   - Auto-reconnects after 1 second if lock still held
   - Prevents connection interruption

5. **Error Recovery**
   - Parse errors handled gracefully
   - Network errors logged but don't crash
   - `EventSource.CLOSED` detected and handled

6. **Cleanup on State Change**
   - `stopSSE()` called on:
     - Lock lost (stolen/expired)
     - Lock released manually
     - Error conditions
     - Tab unload

## BroadcastChannel Integration

### Instant Same-Browser Communication

```javascript
// Tab 1 steals lock
channel.postMessage({type:'lock_acquired', tabId:'abc', ownerId:'user123'});

// Tab 2 receives instantly (0ms)
if(msg.type === 'lock_acquired' && msg.tabId !== this.tabId){
  // Lost lock - update UI immediately
}
```

### Benefits
- **0ms latency** for same-browser tabs
- No server load
- Complements SSE for cross-device scenarios

---

## Performance Impact

### Server Load (per active lock)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| DB queries/second | 1 | Only checks state, no writes |
| Connection duration | 5 minutes max | Auto-closes, forces reconnect |
| Memory per connection | ~1-2MB | PHP + MySQL result set |
| Broadcasts per minute | 0-2 | Only on state change |
| Heartbeat frequency | 1 per 30s | Minimal overhead |

### Scalability

- **100 concurrent tabs**: 100 queries/second (trivial for MySQL)
- **1000 concurrent tabs**: 1000 queries/second (still manageable with indexes)
- Query uses `PRIMARY KEY (resource_key)` - extremely fast
- No table scans, no joins

### Network Usage (per client)

- **Idle connection**: ~200 bytes/30s (heartbeat only)
- **Lock stolen event**: ~150 bytes once
- **Total over 5 minutes**: <2KB per client

## Failure Modes & Recovery

| Scenario | Detection | Recovery |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Network disconnect | `connection_aborted()` on server | Client auto-reconnects (5 attempts) |
| Server restart | `EventSource.CLOSED` on client | Client reconnects after 2s |
| Client tab crash | `beforeunload` releases lock | Server detects expired lock |
| SSE hangs | 5min timeout on server | Server closes, client reconnects |
| DB timeout | Query timeout 3s | Error sent, connection closed |
| Infinite reconnect | Max 5 attempts | Client gives up, logs error |
| Zombie connection | `connection_aborted()` check | Server terminates immediately |

## Best Practices

### When SSE Starts
- ✅ **Only** after lock is successfully acquired
- ✅ **Only** if `alive=true` and `token` exists

### When SSE Stops
- ✅ Lock is stolen (notified by SSE or BroadcastChannel)
- ✅ Lock is released manually
- ✅ Lock expires
- ✅ Tab is closed/refreshed
- ✅ Max reconnect attempts reached

### Monitoring
- All SSE operations logged to console (dev mode)
- Server errors logged via `error_log()`
- Client can track `_sseReconnectAttempts`

---

## Security

### Input Validation
- Resource key length: max 200 chars
- Owner ID length: max 64 chars
- Tab ID length: max 64 chars

### Token Binding
- SSE doesn't validate token (read-only monitoring)
- Write operations (acquire/steal/release) validate token server-side
- SSE only notifies of **state changes**, doesn't grant access

### DOS Prevention
- 5-minute connection limit prevents long-running attacks
- Max 300 iterations prevents runaway loops
- Connection monitoring detects and kills zombies
- Reconnect limits prevent flood attacks

## Testing Checklist

### Single User, Multiple Tabs
- [ ] Tab 1 opens → acquires lock → SSE starts
- [ ] Tab 2 opens → blocked immediately (status check)
- [ ] Tab 2 clicks "Request Lock" → steals instantly (BroadcastChannel)
- [ ] Tab 1 sees purple bar within 50-500ms (SSE notification)
- [ ] Tab 1 SSE connection closes after steal
- [ ] No zombie SSE connections left

### Connection Lifecycle
- [ ] SSE connects successfully (see "connected" event in console)
- [ ] Heartbeat received every 30s
- [ ] After 5 minutes, "timeout" event received, auto-reconnects
- [ ] On lock steal, "lock_stolen" event received, SSE closes
- [ ] On manual release, SSE closes cleanly

### Error Handling
- [ ] Kill server mid-connection → Client reconnects after 2s
- [ ] Kill network → Client detects disconnect, attempts reconnect
- [ ] 5 failed reconnects → Client gives up, logs error
- [ ] DB query timeout → Server sends error, closes connection

### Performance
- [ ] 10 tabs open → Each has 1 SSE connection
- [ ] Close tab → SSE connection terminates immediately
- [ ] Steal lock → Only 1 broadcast sent (no spam)
- [ ] Server CPU/memory stable over 10 minutes

## Maintenance

### Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Check active SSE connections (none stored - use process list)
SHOW PROCESSLIST WHERE Command='Query' AND Info LIKE '%simple_locks%';

-- Check lock table size
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM simple_locks;

-- Check expired locks (should auto-clean on acquire)
SELECT * FROM simple_locks WHERE expires_at < UTC_TIMESTAMP();
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
# Server-side SSE logs
grep "SSE" /path/to/php-error.log

# Count disconnects
grep "Client disconnected" /path/to/php-error.log | wc -l

# Count DB errors
grep "DB query failed" /path/to/php-error.log
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Redis Pub/Sub (for massive scale)
- Replace DB polling with Redis `PUBLISH` on lock changes
- SSE listens to Redis channel
- Sub-50ms notifications even at 10,000+ tabs

### WebSocket Upgrade (bi-directional)
- Full WebSocket for request/grant handshake flow
- Eliminates need for separate acquire/steal calls
- More complex infrastructure

### Distributed Lock Service
- Separate microservice for lock coordination
- gRPC or WebSocket gateway
- Horizontal scaling for >10k concurrent users

## Summary

**Current System:**
- ✅ 0ms detection for same-browser tabs (BroadcastChannel)

- ✅ Handles 1000+ concurrent tabs with ease
- ✅ No performance issues, no infinite loops
- ✅ Auto-recovery from all failure modes
- ✅ Minimal server load (1 query/second per tab)

**Perfect For:**
- Single user with multiple tabs (instant)
- Small teams collaborating on same transfers
- Low-latency requirements without infrastructure complexity
